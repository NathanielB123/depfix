# DepFix: Dependent Fixpoints!

Positive (but not strictly!) iso-recursive types implemented in Agda with `postulate`s and `rewrite` rules. My main motivation with exploring this is to see if these ideas might work for a core theory of my own language (i.e. as an alternative to W-types).

Positive Inductive Types: [Simple.agda](./src/Simple.agda)
Inductive-Recursive Types: [IndRec.agda](./src/IndRec.agda)
Inductive-Inductive Types: WIP
Indexed Types: WIP

If anyone knows of any papers/other resources exploring this or similar approaches to adding iso-recursive types in dependent type systems please let me know, I have really struggled to find anything!
